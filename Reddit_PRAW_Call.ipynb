      "Last week I was driving home from my friend's house when I noticed someone driving very erratically. They were swerving when there was nothing to avoid and they couldn't stay in their lane so I called the police and followed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police caught up to us after a while and they pulled over the driver. It turns out that he was extremely drunk and when they gave him the sobriety tests he failed them miserably. He was arrested and the police asked me to write a statement and give them my information.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave one of the cops my driver's license (I'm under 18) so he could copy my address and he said that I wasn't allowed to be driving because it was past 11. I told him that I would've been home by 11 but I noticed the drunk driver and I didn't want someone to get hurt so I followed them. Plus when I called them they asked me to keep following the man even though it was technically past curfew.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer said that it didn't matter even if me driving past curfew meant that World War 3 was prevented, that the law is the law and that he had to give me a ticket because I broke curfew. He said he would have to give me another ticket if I drove home myself so I called my parents and they came and picked me up (and drove the car I was driving home).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Basically what that is: The justification defense is a legal principle where an individual admits to committing a criminal act but argues that their actions were necessary and therefore justified under the circumstances. Instead of denying the act, they claim it wasn't wrong. This defense is rooted in the idea that in certain situations, a person's conduct, while technically a crime, is socially acceptable or even desirable because it prevents a greater harm. Common examples include self-defense, where a person uses force to protect themselves from an imminent threat, or the \"necessity defense,\" where an individual breaks the law to avoid a more significant and unavoidable harm. If successful, the justification defense can lead to an acquittal, as the court deems the defendant's actions to be non-criminal.**\n",
      "\n",
      "[Update]  **Apr 28, 2019 (7 weeks later)**\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "\n",
      "I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the \"justification\" law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he \"went to investigate\" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!\n",
      "\n",
      "​\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said \"the law is the law.\" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!\n",

All it would have taken is a 'be sure to go straight home, it's after curfew, but you did the right thing this time!' Calling the parents would have also been understandable, but the ticket was ridiculous.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. 911 would never tell them to keep following. If there had been an accident, emergency services would have been on the line for culpability. Because of this, it’s standard for them to advise you back off and let authorities take over. If you want to keep following, that’s on you but as a rule, they don’t leave themselves open for liability. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. I really don’t think the cop would have A) issued the ticket at all or B) actually shown up to court. Even if they felt they needed to go ahead and issue a ticket instead of a warning, cops know if they don’t show up for court—an inaction that has zero repercussions for them—the ticket gets thrown out. Sure, I believe there’s vindictive, power-hungry cops out there (a whole lot of them), but I really think they’d know that a ticket in this situation would get thrown out anyway. I have an easier time believing the cop would have warned OOP not to follow next time for their own safety and maybe given them an official warning or a simple finger-wagging about the curfew thing.  \n",

      ">>\tcheraphy (+0): The timing also feels off. 7 weeks for a hearing on your plea in response to a ticket is reasonable. It's going to be at least long afterwards before you actually go to trial if you plead not guilty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also the way he described evidence being presented at trial doesn't sound like it follow the rules. I'm not a lawyer so take that point with all of the requisite salt\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>\t\tscandalliances (+0): These types of traffic offenses are frequently informal hearings in front of a judge or magistrate — they don’t go through a super formalized process of evidence introduction that “normal” trials do. Like if a police officer is testifying about a speeding ticket and used LIDAR to get the speed, they just have to explain how LIDAR works, they don’t have to bring the specific unit they used and demonstrate it. They MIGHT have to produce more as part of discovery in an appeal or formal trial (like a body cam or whatever would support their LIDAR evidence), but informal hearings usually don’t go beyond testimony in terms of prosecutorial evidence, since you only need preponderance of the evidence to prove your case.\n",
